My interest in computer developed from computer games! Still I remember spending hours playing Commmando and Sim City. I learned to do programming in C from my own interest several years before I took admission in university. At that time I didn't even imagine that this leisure time fun activity would help me to decide my Aim in Life.
</p>I graduated as a computer science and eningeering student with Distinction from Khulna University Bangladesh. After completing my graduation I started my career in academia. Sharing of knowledge with students was a great pleasure. Each moment I felt I was learning something new -  guiding young people, expressing thoughts, creating new ideas and so on. Teaching sharpened my skills to share my knowledge in a geat deal. Here I got the meaning of the quote from Buddha "Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened." I earned my M.Sc in Ultra-large scale software sytems from Queen's university, Kingston.

</p>When I am not working I like passing time with my family and friends, experimenting new cooking recipes and playing computer games.
