description: <div style="text-align:left;">Change in software code is inevitable. Identifying change-prone source files before releasing a software can save the extra efforts and costs required to identify and modify them once released. Manually identifying which source files may require changes in future is almost impossible for many reasons such as the size of a codebase. </p>Machine learning is often used to perform various prediction tasks. This project trains trending machine learning algorithms with codebase change history of two php projects, and predicts which files may require change in future. It uses language features extracted from language grammar as feature variables and change history as labels. In this process each source file is encoded using the usage frequency of different language features. Experimetal results show promising performance. It can help software developers to take precautionary steps to reduce changes in codebase before releasing a software. Details of the project and source code is available at <a href="https://toashiqur.github.io/software-change-prediction/">Source File Change Prediction</a></div>
