description:  <div style="text-align:left;">Like natural languages programming languages also evolve over time. After releasing a programming languge, developers add new features to meet the needs of programmers, and remove features which are not efficient or simply a bad idea. </p>This is a grammar-based project that automatically extracts the use of language features from the parse tree of source code. Based on the discovered use of frequency developers can make important decisions like removing or improving a particular feature. A large corpus of PHP source code has been analyzed in this project to find the usage frequency of different PHP features. PHP feature analysis results and source code are available at <a href="https://toashiqur.github.io/PHP-Feature-Analysis/">PHP Feature Analysis</a></div>
