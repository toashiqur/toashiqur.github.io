description:  <div style="text-align:left;"><i>Reinforcement Learning</i> is a goal-oriented machine learning technique where an agent automatically learns to solve a problem by interacting with its environment. An agent makes decision based on its policy, and may receive rewards or punishments depending on whether the decision is taking it towards or away from the goal. Through a trial and error process it tries to maximize the rewards. Q-Learning, SARSA, DQN are examples of reinforcement learning algorithms. </p>This project programs an agent to reach to a goal state automatically in a world of 150 states. Q-Learning was used to train the agent.
