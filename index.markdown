**[Click here to download my CV][cv-link]**

My interest in computer developed from computer games! Still I remember spending hours playing Commmandos and Sim City. I learned programming in C from my own interest several years before I took admission in university. At that time I didn't even imagine that this leisure time fun activity would help me to decide my Aim in Life.

I graduated as a computer science and eningeering student with Distinction from Khulna University Bangladesh. After completing my graduation I started my career in academia. Sharing of knowledge with students was a great pleasure. Each moment I felt I was learning something new -  guiding young people, expressing thoughts, creating new ideas and so on. Teaching sharpened my skills to share my knowledge in a geat deal. Here I got the meaning of the quote from Buddha "Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened." 

I received my M.Sc in Ultra-large scale software sytems from Queen's university, Kingston. As a Machine Learning Research Assistant at Software Technology Lab, Queen's University, I am working with estimating software quality. Feature engineering, model optimization, visualization, and statiscal analysis are of a great interest to me.

When I am not working I like passing time with my family and friends, experimenting new cooking recipes, reading novels and obviously playing computer games!
